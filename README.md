# Metal-Smelter
A custom-designed enclosure and propane torch used to melt various metals.
# Initial-Planning
The 
# First Prototype
The first prototype was a forced-air wood-burning furnace made in the ground. It had to be destroyed before this log was written, so only drawings are available.

Advantages
- Able to melt aluminum
- Heated up crucible quickly

Disadvantages
- Too much smoke and ash were produced
- Opening the cover, stopping the blower, and taking out the crucible to refill the wood was inefficient and dangerous
- Inability to quickly extinguish and light fire made refilling and slag removal dangerous
- Cover was not stable
- Crucible was not durable or stable

# Second Protoype
The second prototype was a propane torch with its own insulated chamber.

Advantages
- Refinement and casting of aluminum was faster and safer

Disadvantages
- Torch was cumbersome to light and position
- Shape of gas inlet led to inefficient burning
- Position of gas inlet led to inefficient gas flow and chamber heating
- Chamber insulation and cover were not optimised and degraded over time

# Third Prototype
The third protoype was a propane/pressurised air torch with an improved insulated chamber.
